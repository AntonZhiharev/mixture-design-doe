Script to update streamlit_app.py imports to use the simplified mixture design
"""

# Key changes needed in streamlit_app.py:

# 1. Replace the imports section at the top:
OLD_IMPORTS = """
# Import from mixture_designs for mixture design functionality
from mixture_designs import MixtureDesignGenerator, MixtureDesign
from mixture_base import MixtureBase
from fixed_parts_mixture_designs import FixedPartsMixtureDesign

NEW_IMPORTS = """
# Import from simplified mixture design
from core.simplified_mixture_design import (
    create_mixture_design,
    SimplexLatticeDesign,
    SimplexCentroidDesign,
    DOptimalMixtureDesign,
    ExtremeVerticesDesign,
    CustomMixtureDesign
)
"""

# 2. Replace the mixture design generation code:
OLD_GENERATION = """
# Example of old code:
mixture = MixtureDesign(n_components, all_component_names, component_bounds)
variable_design = mixture.generate_d_optimal(n_runs, model_type, random_seed)
"""

NEW_GENERATION = """
# Example of new code:
design_df = create_mixture_design(
    method='d-optimal',
    n_components=n_components,
    component_names=all_component_names,
    n_runs=n_runs,
    include_interior=True  # Important for better D-efficiency!
)
variable_design = design_df.values
"""

# 3. Update method names mapping:
METHOD_MAPPING = {
    "D-optimal": "d-optimal",
    "I-optimal": "i-optimal",  # Note: I-optimal not in simplified version yet
    "Simplex Lattice": "simplex-lattice",
    "Simplex Centroid": "simplex-centroid",
    "Extreme Vertices": "extreme-vertices",
    "Space-Filling": "space-filling",  # Not in simplified version
    "Custom": "custom"

print("\n3. Use 'include_interior=True' for D-optimal to get better efficiency")
